## Design
This app was built collaborating with ChatGPT-4 over about 8 hours. I just used the default Chromebook text editor and copy/paste back and forth. While it would be great to have the forsight of starting in Git, I'm afraid the only history I have is a copy of the folder I made when I thought it was "pretty neat".

Enjoy!
